<h2>Get to the portal, Burt!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
I can be the fastest man alive, but only if I keep running through those blue portals!  Jump over the gaps and keep going!   
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to be caught up in the excitement as they run faster and faster, gradually increasing in speed as they careen across the stage.  
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The game is a jumping game.  
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can perform basic movement and jumping actions with the direction arrows on the keyboard.  The core mechanic is the animated sprite, which walks realistically.  Push left and right arrows to move left and right, and push the up arrow while on the ground to jump.  The core mechanic is running across the stage and jumping over blocks while your speed changes every time you succeed.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating randomly generating levels as-needed.  
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
A random level generator that provides an endless variety of levels to run across is made even better by gradually making you faster the more you play.  Future versions will include multiple kinds of blocks.  
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
I (the character) love to run, just like four year olds!  Help me run, run, run.  
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game has no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I am trying to reach simpleminded four year old children with this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
This game usually takes less then two minutes to play, but can be played forever.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should rush ahead and try to go as fast as possible.  Alternately they can take things most slowly and be extra careful to jump over the holes.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All Assets were made from scratch aside from the cheering sound, which is from http://soundbible.com/2103-1-Person-Cheering.html
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed from no Phaser example.  This game most closely resembles early block-moving games like Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
